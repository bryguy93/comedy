She&rsquo;s a hilariously relatable performer of sheer silliness, vulnerability, and ridiculous characters. Her countless comedic character videos have racked up over 50 million views on social media. Her audience is multigenerational, creating an excuse for large groups of friends and families to spend a night out together. In an era where only 10% of all touring comedians are female, Jessica stands out as one of the strongest comedians regardless of gender. Jessica produced FX&rsquo;s Hysterical, a feature-length documentary that premiered at SXSW 2021. The film explores the changing landscape of women in stand-up comedy and features Margaret Cho, Nikki Glazer, Chelsea Handler, Fortune Feimster, and other notable comedians. Her one-hour special Talking to Myself was executive produced by Bill Burr and debuted on Comedy Central. She is a regular on This Week at the Comedy Cellar and has appeared on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, The View, HBO&rsquo;s, Crashing, and Kevin Can Wait. She also recently acted in and served as a consultant, producer, and writer on the Robert De Niro film The Comedian. Jessica&rsquo;s highly anticipated prank call album, The Call Girls, also featuring Rachel Feinstein, was released on September 24th. Recorded virtually during the depths of quarantine, the album features characters such as old Jewish grandmothers, sexy co-eds, a conservative mother and her gay son, and more. Jessica&rsquo;s characters are coming to life in her new podcast, Disgusting Hawk with rave reviews. Through her Relatively Sane podcast, Jessica has interviewed the likes of Bill Burr, Jim Gaffigan, and Rosie O&rsquo;Donnell. She was awarded &ldquo;Best Female Comic&rdquo; by the MAC association in New York City and received the prestigious Nightlife Award for &ldquo;Best Stand-up Comedian.&rdquo; In her spare time, Jessica is a regular contributor to The Howard Stern Show, where she produces and stars in prank calls for the program.<br><br>",      "organizer": {        "@type": "Organization",        "name": "New York Comedy Club",        "url": "https://newyorkcomedyclub.com"      },      "performer": [{"@type":"Person","name":"Jessica Kirson"}]    }    ,        {      "@context": "http://schema.org",      "@type": "ComedyEvent",      "name": "Nore Davis, Ashley Austin Morris, Liz Glazer, Adam Gilbert",      "startDate": "2024-03-12T

She&rsquo;s a hilariously relatable performer of sheer silliness, vulnerability, and ridiculous characters. Her countless comedic character videos have racked up over 50 million views on social media. Her audience is multigenerational, creating an excuse for large groups of friends and families to spend a night out together. In an era where only 10% of all touring comedians are female, Jessica stands out as one of the strongest comedians regardless of gender. Jessica produced FX&rsquo;s Hysterical, a feature-length documentary that premiered at SXSW 2021. The film explores the changing landscape of women in stand-up comedy and features Margaret Cho, Nikki Glazer, Chelsea Handler, Fortune Feimster, and other notable comedians. Her one-hour special Talking to Myself was executive produced by Bill Burr and debuted on Comedy Central. She is a regular on This Week at the Comedy Cellar and has appeared on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, The View, HBO&rsquo;s, Crashing, and Kevin Can Wait. She also recently acted in and served as a consultant, producer, and writer on the Robert De Niro film The Comedian. Jessica&rsquo;s highly anticipated prank call album, The Call Girls, also featuring Rachel Feinstein, was released on September 24th. Recorded virtually during the depths of quarantine, the album features characters such as old Jewish grandmothers, sexy co-eds, a conservative mother and her gay son, and more. Jessica&rsquo;s characters are coming to life in her new podcast, Disgusting Hawk with rave reviews. Through her Relatively Sane podcast, Jessica has interviewed the likes of Bill Burr, Jim Gaffigan, and Rosie O&rsquo;Donnell. She was awarded &ldquo;Best Female Comic&rdquo; by the MAC association in New York City and received the prestigious Nightlife Award for &ldquo;Best Stand-up Comedian.&rdquo; In her spare time, Jessica is a regular contributor to The Howard Stern Show, where she produces and stars in prank calls for the program.<br><br>",      "organizer": {        "@type": "Organization",        "name": "New York Comedy Club",        "url": "https://newyorkcomedyclub.com"      },      "performer": [{"@type":"Person","name":"Jessica Kirson"}]    }    ,        {      "@context": "http://schema.org",      "@type": "ComedyEvent",      "name": "NICE TRY, Michael Kosta ",      "startDate": "2024-03-12T

Starting over 20 years ago and cutting his teeth in all the major clubs in NYC, including the Comedy Cellar, he then ventured off to Los Angeles, began working at the Comedy Store and Hollywood Improv, and his career really took off. After becoming a regular on the late-night talk show circuit and even doing &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; ten times, Steve racked up multiple hour specials on Comedy Central, Netflix, and Showtime. In 2012, he starred in, produced and wrote the TBS hit show &quot;Sullivan &amp; Son&quot;, which ran for 3 seasons. Through the show, he cultivated a deep appreciation for storytelling, and in 2019 released his first film, &quot;Always Amazing&quot;, a documentary about comic/magician the Amazing Johnathan. In 2020, Steve wrote and directed the indie feature &quot;The Opening Act&quot;, his love letter to stand-up comedy, that garnered critic and audience ratings on Rotten Tomatoes at 82 and 83% Fresh. In 2022, he released his fifth hour special, &quot;The Last Late Night&quot;, on Amazon Prime, his most innovative work to date and rated 5/5 stars &ndash; an hour special disguised as a late-night talk show. Steve continues to tour relentlessly, work on material, and is currently casting his next film that he wrote and will direct towards the end of this year.</div><br>",      "organizer": {        "@type": "Organization",        "name": "New York Comedy Club",        "url": "https://newyorkcomedyclub.com"      },      "performer": [{"@type":"Person","name":"Steve Byrne"}]    }    ,        {      "@context": "http://schema.org",      "@type": "ComedyEvent",      "name": "NICE TRY, Michael Kosta ",      "startDate": "2024-03-19T
